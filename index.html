        <p>
          I purchased a Pebble Time right before Christmas last year, and so far I'm a happy customer. I'm so happy in fact that I 
          coded my very own watchface that took advantage of the Pebble date/time services (obviously), as well as the battery service 
          to include a battery life indicator in the middle of the watchface.
        </p>

        <p>
          A failed experiment when I was trying to used different fonts. I didn't know that pebble devices only supported up to
          48-point font sizes, but I didn't want this to just disappear.
        </p>
        <h4><a href="https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/5802492988277fe07a0000bf">Kota</a></h4>
        <p>
          This watchface was developed for my fiance after I got her a Pebble 2 during their kickstarter campaign.

        <p>
          This watchface of mine has more downloads than any other watchface I've developed. It's a clean watchface with 
          a clean design, a nice font, and it displays a step counter as well as the current weather.

        <h3>CoffeeScript Projects</h3>
        <h4>pharmbot, a <a href="https://hubot.github.com/">hubot</a></h4>
        <p>
          During a late night of manual testing, our team at Cerner (the Pharmacy Inpatient team) made a mascot called 
          pharmbot. It was constructed out of a cardboard box and plastic silverware.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inspired by our fearless mascot, I created a hubot named pharmbot, who resides on a rasbperry pi in my cubicle.
        </p>
        <h4><a href="https://github.com/jvarness/hubot-yelp">hubot-yelp</a></h4>
        <p>
          This project was my first npm package and my first hubot script package! It adds the functionality for your hubot to 
          find a place for you to eat lunch. See the project's README for more!
        </p>
        <h4><a href="https://github.com/jvarness/hubot-barkeep">hubot-barkeep</a></h4>
        <p>
          Probably my most favorite script I've ever made, hubot-barkeep turns your hubot into a bartender! Using this script, 
          your hubot will be enhanced with the capability to query
        </p>

          A big shoutout to <a href="https://github.com/michaeljacobdavis">michaeljacobdavis</a> for developing this originally,
          but I've made contributions to his repo to add release and membership addition notifications to a hubot.
