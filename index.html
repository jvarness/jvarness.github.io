        Hey there! you landed on my Github Page! Wow, I uh... I honestly didn't think anyone really landed on
        this thing anymore. If you're reading this, I don't really update this page anymore, as I've written
        my very own blog!
        </p>
        <p>
        I post content there every so often, sometimes it's stuff that's useful! If you're interested in checking
        it out, you can find it at <a href="https://jvarness.blog" target="_blank">jvarness.blog</a>
        </p>
        <p>
        When I initially created this page, I didn't really know much about the web or JavaScript or anything
        of that nature, but I've learned a lot in over a decade of professional experience, and maybe I can
        help impart some of that knowledge to you or someone you know.
        </p>
        <p>
        Anyway, thanks for reading, check out my blog, and if you have any questions, find my socials on my blog
        and feel free to reach out!
